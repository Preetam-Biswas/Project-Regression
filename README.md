# Project-Regression
In this project, we have been asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast hourly bike rental demand.

I have performed both Univariate and Bivariate Analyses and drew insights from the Correlation mapping to have a good understanding about the variables. Then I have performed a Linear Regression and used Decision Tree ML algorithm for predictions.

Later I validated the predictions using R-squared and conclude the project.
